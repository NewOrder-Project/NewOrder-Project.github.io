<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Discourse on scientific knowledge is essential for making informed decisions on urgent societal issues. The
        COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased public interest in scientific knowledge, which is reflected in the
        growing importance of science communication as part of a broader societal discourse in social and online news media.</p>
    <p> Recent work (<a href="#footnote-1">Fraser et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#footnote-2">Van Schalkwyk & Dudek, 2022</a>;
        <a href="#footnote-3">Neuberger et al. 2021</a>) has shown that such trends are leading to a dissolution of the traditional scientific knowledge
        order, particularly with regard to the traditional phases, contexts, roles and hierarchies of knowledge
        production. Risks arise from oversimplification, generalisation or political instrumentalisation of scientific
        knowledge, which can have a detrimental effect on public perception, decision-making and the polarisation of society.
        This is all the more problematic as false and controversial information spreads faster than the truth. This
        project aims to improve understanding of the changing role of science in the emerging knowledge order of the digital society.</p>
    <p> Through an interdisciplinary consortium combining expertise from science communication, cognitive and social
        psychology, and computer science, we pursue three goals: 1) understanding the erosion of the traditional knowledge
        order in dynamically evolving crisis situations, in particular the dissolution of phases and contexts of production,
        testing and dissemination of scientific knowledge, 2) understanding the perception of roles, sources and
        hierarchies in online scientific discourse and their impact on individuals' trustworthiness judgements and
        knowledge gain, and 3) providing natural language processing (NLP) methods for detecting and classifying roles,
        hierarchies or scientific statements in large-scale online discourse. The project will focus on scientific
        discourse in online news and social media, in particular Twitter, and develop new data sources with a particular
        focus on discourse in DACH countries and Anglophone regions.</p>

<p>The NewOrder team hold a project workshop at Mickeln Castle, which was funded by Heine Centre for Artificial
    Intelligence and Data Science (HeiCAD) and the Düsseldorf Institute for Internet and Democracy.
In this workshop the NewOrder team discussed with external guests various topics about trust in
online discourse, including role perception in social media, philosophical perspectives on trust in science as well as
aspects of politicisation.</p>

<p>We thank Nicole Krämer, Julia Mirkin and Isabella Peters for being our guests and their interesting talks!
    Thanks also to the Heine Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (HeiCAD) and the
    Düsseldorf Institute for Internet and Democracy for supporting the event,
    as well as Anna-Maria Linstaedt and Till Fahnenstich, who helped organise the event for the DIID.</p>

<p>The NewOrder team hold a project workshop at Mickeln Castle. As part of a DIID workshop (Düsseldorf Institute for Internet
and Democracy) DIID researchers and colleagues from other universities discussed the currrent state of the project
and gathered ideas for follow-up projects. </p>

<p>We thank Nicole Krämer, Julia Mirkin and Isabella Peters for being our guests and their interesting talks!
    Thanks also to the Heine Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (HeiCAD) for supporting the event,
    as well as Anna-Maria Linstaedt and Till Fahnenstich, who helped organise the event for the DIID.</p>

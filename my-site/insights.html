<h2> Dissolution of Phases and Contexts </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Usage and perception of preprints in scientific online discourse </li>
    <li> A digitalization of scientific research exist, leaded by technical sciences, followed by natural sciences </li>
    <ul>
    <li> Preprints are
    <ul>
    <li> perceived as useful by researchers. However, non-users see preprints as harmful for the peer review process</li>
        <li> detailed information requires an additional click</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2> Perception of Roles, Credibility and Trust </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Roles are likely to be confused in social media when...
    <ul>
    <li> no additional profile information is displayed </li>
        <li> detailed information requires an additional click</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>How do people perceive information from different senders on social
media - especially when it comes to science? This question guided two
online experiments in which we explored whether users correctly
categorise and consequently remember the roles of different senders
(e.g., scientists or laypeople) or whether they confuse the roles, due
to not having enough information about the senders. Our findings
suggest that people confuse the senders’ role in the context of
scientific communication - particularly when profile information is
not visible. However, users who actively sought for profile
information of the senders were significantly better at identifying the sender’s role.
These results are presented in a scientific article currently under
review at Human Communication Research.</p>

<p> Building on the experiments on role perception, we are conducting a
second series of experiments to investigate how scrolling behaviour on
social media affects the perceived credibility of posts and their
senders. Participants were exposed to posts sharing scientific papers,
preprints, or misinformation, supposedly posted by scientists,
journalists, or laypeople. Initial findings reveal that both
scientists and journalists tend to be seen as more credible than
laypeople - even when scrolling. Misinformation, as expected, is rated
less credible than peer-reviewed papers or preprints. Intriguingly,
the type of content seemed to influence credibility judgments more
than the sender’s role. </p>

<p> To gain a deeper understanding of how demographic and psychological
predictors, as well as (social) media use, affect trust in science in
the long term, we also conducted a four-wave longitudinal survey
involving 1,462 participants. In addition to demographic data, the
survey captured psychological and media-related variables such as
science-related populist attitudes, conspiracy mentality, critical
thinking, and social media usage. The full dataset has been collected
and is now being analyzed to uncover long-term patterns in public
trust in science.</p>
